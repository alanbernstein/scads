Miscellaneous models for 3d printing, in [openscad](https://openscad.org/), often using [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2). A lot of these are custom-fit to specific objects.

I'd like to switch over to [pythonscad](https://pythonscad.org/), but it's not quite functional for me yet. When it is, I'm looking forward to doing some more interesting work using SDFs via [lib5](https://libfive.com/).

## Fun prints

### Vtech toy toolbox screwdriver
[This](https://www.vtechkids.com/product/detail/17143) toy tolbox comes with screws, a wrench, and a pistol-grip driver, but no standard screwdriver. I designed the missing tool, which mates with both the "phillips" head, the hex head, and the wrench.

### Signet ring
I designed this a long time ago as a modeling challenge, then printed it in high quality in resin with my company logo. Many years later my daughter discovered that 3d printing can be used for jewelry, so I updated it to work for all finger sizes, added some new image options, and made it work with multiple colors.

## Functional prints

These are mostly simple devices. Because most of them need to mate with another object, the tolerance requirements can be tricky, so they can be deceptively time-consuming to design.

### Carboard grommet for pi√±ata hanging

Toroidally rounded hole for stress relief for the rope, large cylindrical hole through the cardboard for higher strength.

### 1/4" bit holder
A socket wrench holder for a 9-piece set of 1/4" drive sockets ([e.g.](https://www.amazon.com/Belt-sock-set-drv-pieces/dp/B0757ZN7C6)), plus a hex drive adapter.

I also set up a parameter grid for testing a range of dimensional values for a fit test:

### T-track gearwall components
I built a custom heavy-duty garage pegboard system using t-tracks, normally used for things like router tables.

### Compact stadiometer device

I have a [wall ruler](https://www.amazon.com/Kate-Laurel-Growth-Chart-Rustic/dp/B073V6JFZ1) for kid height measurements. Wiggly kids are hard to measure properly. This helps, by holding a perpendicular height stop, with a little window to mark the corresponding spot on the ruler. The height stop is a hollow metal tube (with a printed endcap), and it stows vertically when not in use, along with a pencil.

## Adapter for magnetic phone mount armband

This hand-me-down [phone armband](https://www.amazon.com/VUP-Running-Armband-Rotatable-Walking/dp/B072C3SCW6) is frustrating because you can't remove/attach the phone with one hand. A proper design would include a magnetic/mechanical quick-release mechanism, e.g. the peak design SlimLink mechanism. If you disassemble the [out front bike mount](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/out-front-bike-mount), it fits almost perfectly with the armband. It just needs one little adapter to stay in place.

### Pocket door lock tool
My pocket doors have [fancy locking handles](https://www.emtek.com/all-products/door-hardware/sliding-door-hardware/pocket-door-locks/narrow-modern-rectangular-mortise/), but the door has to be in just the right spot, and low-profile knobs are hard to use while fiddling with the door. This tool mates with the knob to make locking much easier. There is also a wall mount that wedges in between the door frame and wall with a spring.

### bandaid caddy
A weight-minimizing caddy to hold the contents of a costco box of bandaids. Designed to maximize shelf usage in my Ikea Hemnes medicine cabinet. Part one of a series to be continued later.

### Marshmallow stick holder 

I got these [marshmallow sticks](https://www.amazon.com/Marshmallow-Roasting-Extendable-Barbecue-Skewers/dp/B0CD6RXJSW), which is definitely the right way to roast a marshmallow. But when you are trying to manage multiple molten marshmallows, you need to be able to set them down, both over the fire and not. This mount can be staked to the ground near a fire pit.

Also, some caps for the tips, which fit into some holes in the holder.

### Nintendo switch car visor mount, quick-release

I play Zelda on long trips to entertain the kids in the back seat. Using velcro strips sorta worked but I wanted something quicker. I am a big fan of Fidlock buckle hardware, and this was a perfect application of the "snap pull" mechanism. 

- visor mount is laser-cut and bent acrylic.
- visor Fidlock is [snap pull adjuster](https://www.aplusproducts.net/products/snap-pull-female-m-25-adjuster?variant=42485459091633)
- switch Fidlock is [snap screw](https://www.aplusproducts.net/products/fidlock-snap-male-medium-screw-low?variant=41037159170225)

### Cuisinart microwave door mechanism fix
CMW-200 microwave door mechanism hinge broke, not replaceable, glue seems unlikely to hold. The other original hinge might break, should be able to update this to fix that too.

### Doubleshot cherry MX switch keycap

This is designed to work with any SVG image, and print the image in a second, clear material. Intended for a soundboard keyboard with sound icons (work in progress)

## Tent light mount
I bought a tent with an integrated ceiling lamp. It only takes D-cell batteries, which I never use. I unscrewed the light assembly, so I could screw in a loop to hold a hanging usb-rechargable lamp.
